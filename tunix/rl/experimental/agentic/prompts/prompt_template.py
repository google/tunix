"""Prompt Template Constants.

This module defines constant templates for various prompt scenarios.

# Prompt example template
PROMPT_EXAMPLE = """Consider the following github issue:

<github_issue>
{problem_statement}
</github_issue>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository to fix the <github_issue>?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <github_issue>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!

Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <github_issue> is satisfied.

IMPORTANT TIP:
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script ('reproduce_issue.py') to reproduce the error and execute it to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
6. When viewing large files, use specific line-ranges, usually within 50 to 100 lines) as required
7. NOTE: The repository is at '/testbed' and the current working directory is already '/testbed', so DO NOT include 'testbed/' or 'testbed.' in relative paths in bash commands or reproduction python files."""
