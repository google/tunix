# M15 APC target-debug handoff

## Scope and current ceiling

This task is the independent APC/prefix-cache numerical lane. It does not
change production APC defaults and it does not authorize a TPU launch,
commit, or push.

Current immutable facts:

- one-host Qwen3-8B DP1xTP4 Phase3 G-A through G-D is exact;
- M15 `m15i` on DP8xTP8 is A-B red by 1389 bytes / 760 elements and B-C exact;
- the first historical red is row 192, completion position 0, logical prefix
  1226;
- the historical archive has hashes but not reversible tokens/request order/
  cache lineage, so `m15i` itself is not an exact replay carrier;
- no numerical source has been repaired and all production full recipes remain
  APC-off.
- Attempt 0 (`canon-v1-apc-m15-off-d3-eb58954f`) is `INCONCLUSIVE`: it never
  reached alignment or created a serving capture. Its command selected
  `m15/main` on the CLI but omitted `CANON_P57_WORKLOAD_CANDIDATE` and
  `CANON_P57_DATA_SPLIT`, which the FrozenLake entrypoint requires to match.
- The bootstrap repair carries exact `m15/main` identity through the renderer,
  profile, and Step-00 resolver and preserves the package-safe module
  entrypoint. It changes no APC, model, alignment, backward, or optimizer math.

Claim ceiling: `PHASE_B_STATIC_CARRIER_ONLY`.

The exact remote procedure is in [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md). The execution agent
must run those commands rather than constructing a new carrier by hand.

## Prepared bounded carrier

The new renderer creates a matched pair from one committed source tree:

- `off`: APC-off shared-serving control;
- `on`: production-congruent cache-read treatment.

Both use the exact M15 main geometry: DP8xTP8, 32 prompts, 8 generations,
256 trajectories, concurrency 256, `vllm_max_num_seqs=32`, batched tokens 256,
15 turns, prompt 4096, response 8192, temperature 0.7, seed 42. Both stop after
one strict pre-alignment round with zero backward and zero optimizer commit.

The only intended cross-arm values are
`CANON_APC_M15_TARGET_DEBUG=off|on` and derived
`CANON_VLLM_ENABLE_PREFIX_CACHING=0|1`; a structural test rejects any other
document difference after arm-path normalization.

A must attest:

```text
prompt_logprobs=None
logprobs=1
skip_reading_prefix_cache=False
```

B must attest `reset_prefix_cache=True` and zero cached tokens. The classifier
rejects any B-C byte difference, optimizer marker, wrong source, wrong command,
missing capsule/journal/incident join, or M15 classifier failure hidden behind
the expected controlled exit code 42.

For every arm, postflight/GCS collection preserves:

- `m15_producer_unit.npz`: all 256 final token/logprob rows;
- `m15_replay_envelope.jsonl`: every serving call's exact host-side dispatch,
  request, DP slot, prefix hash/position and physical page table.

For a fresh red, postflight additionally creates
`p38_serving_capture/m15_first_red_replay/` with:

- `first_red_capsule.npz`: the earliest exact incident row's complete prompt,
  completion, masks, A/B/C, policy version, and sampling values;
- `first_red_contract.json`: request/call/position, DP slot, physical pages,
  page generations, and co-batch request IDs;
- `SHA256SUMS`.

It then creates `m15_full_replay_carrier/`. Its request-row join proves that
every scheduled token history comes from the saved 256-row producer and that
the first-red request/call/pages match the incident ledger. The full carrier
records scheduler dispatch order but has not yet forced that order through a
replay harness, so it remains input evidence rather than a mechanism verdict.

## CPU validation already run

From the independent worktree:

```bash
cd /home/yuxuan/code_rl_repro/worktrees/v1_apc_m15_target_debug_0824
python3 canon-zero-tim/tasks/v1-apc-m15-target-debug/scripts/test_analyze_m15i_evidence.py -v
python3 canon-zero-tim/tasks/v1-apc-m15-target-debug/scripts/test_classify_m15_apc_target_run.py -v

python3 canon-zero-tim/tasks/v1-apc-m15-target-debug/scripts/test_resolved_env.py -v
python3 canon-zero-tim/tasks/p38-pathways-decode-prefill-carrier/scripts/test_classify_p38_serving_capture.py -v
python3 canon-zero-tim/tests/p3_prefix_cache/test_contract.py -v
python3 canon-zero-tim/.claude/skills/manage-canon-flags/scripts/audit_flag_registry.py \
  --repo . --changed-base ff913a84
bash -n canon-zero-tim/cluster/steps/00_env.sh canon-zero-tim/cluster/steps/90_run.sh
git diff --check
```

All task-specific tests and the flag audit pass. The pinned image
`sha256:418dc632...e53a` was then run on the final runtime/test tree. The first
attempt exposed an image-only test PATH defect (`python3` lives under
`/usr/local/bin`); after the test inherited the active interpreter directory,
the full rerun terminated with `V1_HP_EXACT_IMAGE_PASS ...
apc_m15_carrier=33 ... manifests=3`. This is exact-image admission, not a
one-host numerical replay or DP8xTP8 target result.

The worktree was initially created at reference `687b2bd6...`. The operator
branch later advanced to `ff913a84`; the intervening raw-log and P58 seed
registry changes were reviewed, then the isolated worktree was fast-forwarded
without conflict before the final gates.

## Next action before any launch

Do not relaunch source `eb58954f...`; its missing signed identity is
deterministically invalid. First publish and exact-image-test the bootstrap
repair, then render only from that new full SHA. Publication does not
authorize a launch; the APC-off control and APC-on treatment retain separate
user approval boundaries. Use a unique label and a new output directory:

```bash
cd /home/yuxuan/code_rl_repro/sequence_packing/tunix
SOURCE_SHA=<full-committed-sha>
RUN_ID=<new-unique-label>
OUT=/tmp/v1-apc-m15-${RUN_ID}
python3 canon-zero-tim/cluster/render_v1_apc_m15_target_debug.py \
  --source-commit "$SOURCE_SHA" \
  --run-id "$RUN_ID" \
  --output-dir "$OUT"
sha256sum "$OUT"/*.yaml
```

Do not edit the rendered YAML. Do not render from a dirty or abbreviated SHA.

Before spending the 64-card target, request separate approval to run the
dependency-complete pinned-image gate against the immutable production image:

```bash
cd /home/yuxuan/code_rl_repro/sequence_packing/tunix
bash canon-zero-tim/tests/v1_phase4/run_exact_image.sh \
  sha256:418dc632edd8ff990e8880df6a5ca82369f6c4d705e16152c1ee6f9708d5e53a
```

The post-fix terminal must include `apc_m15_carrier=35`. This remains a CPU/image
admission gate, not a DP8xTP8 numerical result.

Before applying the YAML, the rendered environment must contain all four
members of one workload identity:

```text
CANON_P57_WORKLOAD_CANDIDATE=m15
CANON_P57_DATA_SPLIT=main
--p57_workload_candidate=m15
--p57_data_split=main
```

The checked-in renderer and real Step-00 resolver now enforce this and reject
wrong identity or file-path-entrypoint negatives before TPU work begins.

## Launch order — each needs separate user approval

Run the control first. The launch command must be standalone; do not append a
pipe, `tee`, `&&`, or a monitor:

```bash
kubectl apply -f "$OUT/jobset-v1-apc-m15-off.yaml"
```

Read the raw log only after the JobSet terminates. The control is admissible
only if the embedded `m15_apc_target.classification.json` says
`CONTROL_GREEN`, all B-C bytes are zero, and GCS has `PREFLIGHT.json`,
`COLLECTED.json`, and `COMPLETE.json`. A red control stops the campaign.

Only after that verdict, request separate approval for:

```bash
kubectl apply -f "$OUT/jobset-v1-apc-m15-on.yaml"
```

The treatment has two admissible outcomes:

- `FRESH_TARGET_RED_FROZEN`: proceed to Phase C/D using the bundled first-red
  carrier; do not infer RoPE/page/cache mechanism yet;
- `TARGET_NOT_REPRODUCED`: this one bounded target observation was exact at
  representative depth/cache occupancy; it does not prove APC fixed.

Any `INCONCLUSIVE`, B-C red, missing join, missing GCS terminal marker, or
unexpected optimizer/backward evidence is a hard stop.

## What the remote execution agent must return

Large GCS evidence remains durable and must not be added wholesale to Git. On
the machine that can read the bucket, run the checked-in GCS audit:

```bash
bash canon-zero-tim/tasks/v1-apc-m15-target-debug/scripts/run_m15_replay_gcs_audit.sh \
  gs://yuxzhang-tunix-models/canon-zero-tim/evidence/p38/<jobset>/attempt-0
```

Return these small outputs plus their SHA values:

1. `PREFLIGHT.json`, `COLLECTED.json`, `COMPLETE.json`, and remote
   `SHA256SUMS`;
2. `serving-classification.json`;
3. the derived audit URI and `RETURN_RECEIPT.json`;
4. from the derived audit:
   - `m15-classification.json`;
   - on a red, `first-red-contract.json`, `replay-contract.json`, and
     `request-row-joins.jsonl`;
5. the raw log, or if it is too large, an immutable raw-log URI/SHA plus every
   line containing the alignment-pre marker, M15 APC marker prefix,
   `P3_APC_CONFIG`,
   `Prefix cache hit rate`, `CONTROLLED_EXIT`, and `FATAL`;
6. the exact source SHA, JobSet name, attempt number, GCS prefix, and Kubernetes
   terminal status.

The audit script verifies the remote root manifest and both nested replay
manifests before uploading its own `SHA256SUMS` last. Do not call a hash-valid
subset a complete upload; the three terminal markers and required
classifications remain separate completeness gates.

## Rollback

The new selector is default-off, so publication does not change production
behavior. Reverting this bounded carrier must remove the
renderer/profile/classifier/marker additions as one concern. Production
recipes remain APC-off throughout.
