# BEGIN-GOOGLE-INTERNAL
# Tests for Llama3 model parameter loading from safetensors files.
# WARNING: This test is intended for external environments, such as GCE.
# It should not be run as part of a standard internal codebase or Blaze build.

# Setup:
# 1. Run `huggingface-cli login` to authenticate with Hugging Face
# 2. Ensure you have the corresponding model access.

# Usage:
# Script: python params_test.py
# Jupyter: %run params_test.py

# Each test validates model loading, device placement, and display
# functionality.
# Tests are skipped if model paths are not configured.
# END-GOOGLE-INTERNAL
